This means vegetables, mostly: they’ve got the most nutrition per pound of any food around. Big salads and heaping piles of cauliflower (Yale cauliflower is </span><span class="c21">amazing</span><span>) are key to keeping your body running smoothly. To accompany the veggies: protein will keep you satiated, but excess sugar is likely to leave your stomach growling in the middle of your evening problem set--watch out for Yale’s delicious, but unhealthy, dessert selection. Your classes are stressful enough; no need to put excess stress on your body!</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>After the dining halls close, you may feel the urge to order a Wenzel at 1:30 AM while you are in the library. Resist it. Instead, go to Gourmet Heaven and buy some fruit, nuts, baby carrots and hummus, cottage cheese, etc. Eating unhealthy foods, especially late at night, is a terrible idea, and will only lead to negative health consequences. A healthy body is a healthy mind.</span></p><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.v5fx5vlpd2ul"></a><span>Exercise</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>Exercise releases endorphins and keeps you looking and feeling your best. There are two free gyms (Payne Whitney, plus your residential college gym) within a few blocks of you--use them! Popular exercise times include mornings before breakfast and the time between afternoon class and dinner; 2am workouts are good for staying awake, but not for peak fitness. If you’re not sure you’ll stick to an exercise plan, get a gym buddy--you don’t need to copy their every move, but knowing they’ll be looking for you at 5:00 sharp is a nice incentive to get downstairs and sweat out your troubles! If gyms aren’t your thing, flip forward a page or two and refresh yourself on Yale’s various outdoor exercise and sporting options.</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>There’s nothing wrong with getting a little exercise in every day, but three days per week should be enough to keep you healthy and strong if you strategize. One of the most effective possible cardio workouts only takes 20 minutes: 1 minute running or pedaling or elliptical-ing hard, one minute at a relaxed pace, and repeat ten times.

The easiest way to get there (and how most students run there) is:</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span>From Phelps Gate, turn left. Turn right on Grove Street. Turn left on Orange Street. Go down Orange Street until you hit the winding road that takes you to the top of the park (the top of East Rock). Or, you can take the dirt trail to the top, which is more strenuous. The total round trip distance is about 7.5 miles.</span></p><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.no9zdaglshe1"></a><span>Yale Outdoors</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>Yale Outdoors runs weekly hiking, backpacking, and camping trips that provide a great way to get away on the weekends.

The student health center is open during normal business hours (8:30 AM – 6:00 PM), and is where you would go for most health needs (anything other than needing immediate emergency room care). You can call ahead to make an appointment to avoid waiting in line (highly recommended) at 203-432-0312. If it is busy, you can expect to wait up to an hour or more, so call ahead and you can get right in. Yale Health is a 10-15 minute walk from old campus; you can take the Yale Shuttle from Phelps gate to avoid the walk.</span></p><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.we9k0gy2ngye"></a><span>Acute Care</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>This is Yale Health’s 24/7 medical clinic. When Student Health is closed, Acute Care functions as the student health center, so at any time of night, you can go. They are not set up to handle medical emergencies, so if you are in need of immediate medical attention (hospital-worthy), go to the emergency room. Acute Care is located within the Yale Health building.</span></p><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.13o7s0wztfdm"></a><span>Yale New Haven Hospital </span></h3><p class="c0"><span>This is Yale’s primary hospital, and one of the best in the country. If you are in need of serious medical attention, this is the place to go.</span></p><h2 class="c0"><a name="h.vjrybrnjz4xw"></a><span>Mental Health Resources</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>Mental health is extremely important at Yale, and at college, period. Many students seek out mental health counseling at Yale, and it’s certainly not something to be ashamed of. There are many resources here at Yale.</span></p><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.jxd7z9frdjw9"></a><span>Yale Health Mental Health and Counseling</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>This is based at Yale Health – make an appointment to see a counselor by calling (203) 432-0290. It can take a few days to get an appointment, so if you need URGENT care, see below options.</span></p><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.u41rq355r9m8"></a><span>Immediate Mental Health Attention</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>The best resource that you have as freshmen is your freshman counselor. They are all on call for you 24 hours a day, seven days a week, so call them if you need anything or need someone to talk to (they wouldn’t have applied for, or gotten, the job if they weren’t very companionable people). Acute care is also there 24 hours for mental health emergencies.</span></p><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.nbd3sfrcnelt"></a><span>Other Mental Health Resources</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>There is a variety of other mental health resources at your disposal. Walden Peer Counseling is staffed by Yale students, and provides peer-to-peer support for issues large and small. Call Walden at 203-432-TALK (432-8255), to be connected to one of their counselors. They are available from 8PM-8AM. The Chaplain’s office is also available for mental health counseling and guidance, call them at 203-432-1128. Finally, there are residential college mental health fellows, which can guide you to appropriate resources and offer specialized assistance through the residential college that you are in. Call them at 203-432-0290. There are so many resources at your disposal here at Yale. It is up to you to take advantage of them, and seek out help if you need it. Don’t be embarrassed; it is totally normal and healthy.</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c8"><span></span></p><h1 class="c0 c17"><a name="h.9xcxywmgprvo"></a><span>Time Periods</span></h1><h2 class="c0"><a name="h.urhj772htgym"></a><span>Camp Yale</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>Your nights for the first two weeks of Yale will be filled with icebreakers, speeches, and frank discussions of alcohol policy and sexual harassment, courtesy of your FroCos, Masters, and Deans. A slightly awkward time will be had by most, but the convivial social atmosphere outside the mandatory meetings will help Camp Yale remain one of the most memorable periods of your time on campus. Everyone you meet is a potential best friend, and very few of the people you meet are potential worst enemies (Yalies are gregarious, well-meaning people).</span></p><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.u0xtlk5y4qb"></a><span>Forming Friendships and Adjusting</span></h3><p class="c0"><span class="c12">Put yourself out there.</span><span> It might be difficult at first. Some of the Authors are introverts, too; we understand. But while there is almost never a </span><span class="c21">bad </span><span>time to sit next to strangers at meals and ask to hear their life stories (Finals week is an exception), Camp Yale is almost certainly the </span><span class="c21">best </span><span>time. Your fellow freshmen don’t know anybody, and will be happy to meet you. Upperclassmen are curious about the Class of 2017, and will be an excellent source of guidance in these tumultuous early days.</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>When meeting new people, we recommend </span><span class="c12">starting with your residential college. </span><span>If you join a club or play a sport, you’ll befriend your peers in those areas without much trouble -- but when you return home, you’ll want to have a few friendly faces to sit with for dinner and/or your midnight Buttery run. If you hear a party in the next entryway, knowing your college peers will help you feel better about walking in. Having more friends in your college gives you a better set of options when you choose roommates for sophomore year. Et cetera. One strategy that works nicely is to eat lunch in a different college every day--opening up your horizons--but returning to your own for dinner to familiarize yourself with the locals.</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c12">Quick Tip: </span><span>For icebreakers and first-time conversations, it can help to have an interesting fact or two about yourself in reserve; name, hometown, and residential college only go so far. Think “fun, informative, and unusual”. Examples include: </span></p><ol class="c9 lst-kix_7rtkkmeqmhq-0 start"><li class="c0 c10 c5"><span>“I took a gap year to record an R&amp;B album.”</span></li><li class="c0 c10 c5"><span>“I’m really starting to miss my pet boa constrictor...”</span></li><li class="c0 c10 c5"><span>“I hope to be the first member of the Yale juggling club to work with chainsaws!”</span></li></ol><p class="c0 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>You’ll probably have some nervous moments, but remember that the same is true for all of your fellow students. (They’re just as scared of you as you are of them!) One of the best ways to escape your fear is to take the initiative. Sit down with a smile. Offer a firm handshake (note: after about the first week, the handshakes die down)</span><span class="c12">. </span><span>Ask if they have plans for the evening. If they do, consider tagging along. If not, suggest something!</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Last piece of advice: </span><span class="c12">Don’t panic! </span><span>Two weeks isn’t all that much time, and your circle of friends will </span><span class="c21">never </span><span>be set in stone. John Loge, the sagacious dean of Timothy Dwight college, offers this quotable snippet of Yale wisdom:</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c21">“One step at a time. Take things slowly, things take time. You didn&#39;t develop your closest high school friendships in a day. Neither will you immediately meet your best friends in college.”</span></p><h2 class="c0"><a name="h.urhj772htgym"></a><span>Semester Periods</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>These are usually called “_ period” because they aren’t necessarily a week long. Sometimes they might be called “_ week” because it seems like a week, and that’s a fine name too.</span></p><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.u0xtlk5y4qb"></a><span>Shopping Period</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>Check out the Academics section for detailed information on shopping and choosing classes.</span></p><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.u0xtlk5y4qb"></a><span>Reading Period</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>Reading period is the period of roughly one week before Fall and Spring semester finals. Most classes do not meet during this time, so you have plenty of time to finish papers and study for finals. During spring semester’s reading period, Yale invites a selection of semi-prominent musicians for the bacchanalia known as “Spring Fling”, but you’ll hear about that when the time comes. </span></p><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.u0xtlk5y4qb"></a><span>Finals Period</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>Finals period isn’t much fun, but everyone gets through it! Spread your study time over classes according to their difficulty, pay careful attention to what will actually be on your tests, and take breaks by packing your stuff (you’ll be heading home soon!), or by swapping papers with friends and reading them over to ensure that everything makes sense. </span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c12">Quick Tip: </span><span>Your grades are a measurement, according to a single particular scale, of your proficiency in a narrow branch of one subject. But they are not </span><span class="c21">you</span><span>. Even if things don’t go as planned, you are still a worthwhile and valuable person. </span><span>We love you!</span></p><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.xm4yujqakyz3"></a><span>Deadweek</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>“Deadweek” is the period of time after spring finals but before commencement. It’s fun! Seniors often stay on campus or travel in groups to places like Myrtle Beach. A number of organizations also live on campus during that period. Some assist with commencement, including the Yale Bands, the Glee Club, and people working with the Commencement Musical. Some sports teams have practice and competitions during this time. Many students also take short-term jobs for this period working with reunions and commencement (see yalestudentjobs.org closer to that time for options).</span></p><h2 class="c0"><a name="h.urhj772htgym"></a><span>Summer</span></h2><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.u0xtlk5y4qb"></a><span>Relax!</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>Your summer after freshman year is a great time to relax and recharge! Don’t spend too much of your time working, unless it’s work that you’ll enjoy, and/or work that will help you decide whether to further pursue some particular career path. Take a road trip! Write a novel! Go home to see your family and friends! </span></p><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.u0xtlk5y4qb"></a><span>Yale Summer Session</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>The </span><span class="c2"><a class="c1" href="http://www.yalewiki.org/w/index.php?title=Yale_Summer_Session&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Yale Summer Session</a></span><span> is a popular option for students who wish to earn Yale credit. These classes are offered in two sessions, starting in June or July. Classes are normally conducted in New Haven, but some are also offered abroad and, as of 2012, online. If you are staying in New Haven, you should look for a Facebook group of students staying in New Haven to find out what is going on (other times such as winter break can have similar groups). </span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Many Yale students take summer classes to fulfill develop foreign language skills. Summer gives students the time to focus on time-consuming language programs, and the opportunity for immersion in a foreign country. Certain foreign language programs span two sessions, the first part in New Haven and the second part in a city where that language is spoken (the L1/L2 and L3/L4 French program has its second part in Paris). The </span><span class="c2"><a class="c1" href="http://www.yalewiki.org/wiki/Light_Fellowship">Light Fellowship</a></span><span> is the most popular way to secure funding to study an East Asian language, most commonly Chinese, but check the CIPE website (</span><span class="c2"><a class="c1" href="http://cipe.yalecollege.yale.edu">http://cipe.yalecollege.yale.edu</a></span><span>) for programs that award credit.

Many Yale professors spend the summers on writing projects and hire students to assist them; some physics professors have even granted freshmen summer opportunities to work at CERN! If you are enrolled in Perspectives in Science and Engineering, you already have funding secured for you, given that you find a Yale professor to work with for ~10 weeks over the summer. Otherwise, if you are a freshman interested in science research, you can look into the </span><span class="c2"><a class="c1" href="http://science.yalecollege.yale.edu/stars-home">STARS</a></span><span> program, which provides free housing, classroom research instruction, and a stipend in addition to the research experience.</span></p><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.u0xtlk5y4qb"></a><span>Funding</span></h3><h4 class="c0"><a name="h.bvjbmxh53kzg"></a><span>ISA (International Summer Award), for Classes</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>If you receive financial aid during the academic year, and are eligible to receive the ISA, Yale will give you funds to help support one summer international experience.

Try these tips and experiment to find out how you like to study. While you’re studying, try to pay attention to how much attention you’re paying to your work (meta, we know, but it works!)</span></p><h4 class="c0"><a name="h.33a3oiqfacl1"></a><span>Location</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>Find a study space that works for you; but you can also train yourself to study well in another space! Do you study better in a group or alone? (Most people are better off alone.) Does it depend on the course?</span></p><h4 class="c0"><a name="h.33a3oiqfacl1"></a><span>Do Things Early</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>Learn to do the readings and write papers as soon as they are assigned. Completing papers early leaves you time to re-write and revise them for markedly better results. If you’re ever in something approaching a “work mood”, don’t let it go to waste -- you’ll always have something you can make progress on!</span></p><h4 class="c0"><a name="h.33a3oiqfacl1"></a><span>Study Smart</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>Be realistic with your studying. How much can you accomplish with the time you have? Try setting goals such as planning how many chapters to read for your allotted study time. If you are especially busy, try to zoom in on an interesting part of the book and bring points of discussion from that to class. One well-thought-out, original comment can make up for a lot of missed reading.</span></p><h4 class="c0"><a name="h.33a3oiqfacl1"></a><span>Self-Control</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>Get off Facebook NOW! Psychologists agree that self-control is one of the most important ingredients to success. It can be difficult though, so software can keep you away from websites for you! Programs like SelfControl, for Mac users, block websites for periods of time that you can set. Whitelist, an app for Chrome, is also excellent, giving you access to a few chosen websites (like Wikipedia) and blocking the rest. This can help defer distraction.These are particularly useful before midterms/finals/paper deadlines! </span></p><h3 class="c0 c14"><a name="h.rl32nk6mk5n"></a><span>Help! I can&#39;t study!</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>If you find yourself stuck in a position where you *need *to study but *can&#39;t* study, try these tips:</span></p><h4 class="c0"><a name="h.33a3oiqfacl1"></a><span>Change setting</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>Consider going to a different library, coffee shop, other suite (be careful!). Try being a study-nomad. Some people can&#39;t study in the same location for more than a couple of hours, they &#39;fatigue&#39; of that place. You can also try surrounding yourself with people who are also working.</span></p><h4 class="c0"><a name="h.33a3oiqfacl1"></a><span>Charge your brain</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>Take a jog around the block or through your college basement.

Fifteen minutes works well for us).</span></p><h2 class="c0"><a name="h.nieivp1mzzmi"></a><span>Note-Taking</span></h2><h3 class="c0 c18"><a name="h.rl32nk6mk5n"></a><span>Develop a note-taking method that works for you.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt1" name="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup></h3><h4 class="c0 c18"><a name="h.33a3oiqfacl1"></a><span>1. Go to class prepared.</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>Read assigned material and class notes before class. Mark any material that you don’t understand, so you can ask questions in class. Reviewing the material before class will help you understand what the professor is talking about, and will let you get more out of the class!</span></p><h4 class="c0 c18"><a name="h.33a3oiqfacl1"></a><span>2. Improve your listening skills.</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>Pay attention to the professor! If you are using a computer, don’t check Facebook or other sites. If you are having a hard time staying focused, try writing notes by hand. Don’t start zoning out if someone asks a question you already know the answer to because you may miss information from the professor.</span></p><h4 class="c0 c18"><a name="h.33a3oiqfacl1"></a><span>3. Develop a notetaking method that works for you.</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>Take notes with a consistent structure and organization to maximize speed and efficiency. If you are taking notes by hand, leave some blank spaces, so that you can add comments or questions later. Try to make your notes as concise as possible, using a system of abbreviations and symbols whenever possible. Write down all vocabulary or concepts that you are unfamiliar with, so that you can look them up later.</span></p><h4 class="c0 c18"><a name="h.33a3oiqfacl1"></a><span>4. Play close attention to content.</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>Write down details, facts, or explanations that expand or explain the main points. Examples can help illustrate the material. Also take note of definitions and any information that is repeated or spelled out.</span></p><h4 class="c0 c18"><a name="h.33a3oiqfacl1"></a><span>5. Review and edit your notes.</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>It is best to review your notes within 24 hours of writing them. Edit words and phrases that are hard to read or don’t make sense. Consider editing with a different colored pen to distinguish between what you wrote in class and what was added later. Fill in key words and questions in the left hand column of your notes. Consider rewriting or typing your notes for better memory storage.</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>For additional techniques for study and exam preparation, see the Tips for Effective Study page at </span><span class="c2"><a class="c1" href="http://www.cod.edu/people/faculty/fancher/STUDY.HTM">http://www.cod.edu/people/faculty/fancher/STUDY.HTM</a></span></p><h2 class="c0"><a name="h.nieivp1mzzmi"></a><span>Writing papers</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>If possible try to do the readings and write papers as soon as they are assigned.

Residential College Tutors are the most experienced tutors at Yale and many are professional writers or have taught writing courses at Yale. You can schedule a meeting with them online: </span><span class="c2"><a class="c1" href="http://writing.yalecollege.yale.edu/residential-college-writing-tutors">http://writing.yalecollege.yale.edu/residential-college-writing-tutor,</a></span><span> but they actually respond best to emails. Even if the online schedule is full, it’s worth emailing them, because so many of their slots aren’t listed on the website. Most of them would like to build a relationship with you, and help you with multiple projects.</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>If you’re writing an essay for a class and realize that it would help if someone looked over it once or twice - that’s something the writing tutors are great for! Writing Tutors aren’t just for people who have low writing confidence. The most difficult part is just scheduling, so if you set up appointments with them ahead of time, you’ll be set. It can also help a lot to have additional, earlier deadlines for drafts.</span></p><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.rl32nk6mk5n"></a><span>Writing Center Tutors</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>Located at 35 Broadway, the writing center is a great resource if you need help writing pretty much any kind of paper.  The writing partners are undergrad or grad students who have been selected based on their outstanding writing skills, so they definitely know their stuff.  You can visit the writing center at any point during your writing process, they will help you with anything from brainstorming to editing.  Just make sure you bring a printed copy of your paper if you already have something written! No need to make an appointment, just drop in during the walk in hours Sunday-Thursday 3-5 pm and 7-9 pm and Friday 3-5 pm.</span></p><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.rl32nk6mk5n"></a><span>Science and Quantitative Reasoning Tutors</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>If you are struggling in a class (C+ or below), you can request up to ten hours of tutoring.

Most of the clubs at Yale--well over a hundred in all--will have tables set up to ensnare you. It’s an awe-inspiring look at the breadth of possibilities available to you, and though you have only 168 hours per week to actually fulfill said possibilities, there’s no harm in window-shopping. </span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>But be realistic: There’s nothing wrong with attending a huge number of meetings in the first few weeks to get a feel for each organization that interests you. However, it’s a good idea to set an artificial limit on how many you’ll join; four is a sensible number, but three is even better, especially if you have a job or a tough schedule. If you feel that you have too much spare time next semester, joining a club is easy. On the other hand, quitting a club when your schedule overwhelms you can feel like a betrayal. Choose the former path if at all possible.</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c12">Quick Tip: </span><span>If you don’t want to join an a capella group, the answer to “can you sing?” is “no”.

Most new postings occur at the beginning of the school year but there are always new jobs available. There are a huge range of jobs, requiring different skills. Some are as simple as sitting at a desk in a library (doing your homework). Others require more skill and are more involved, such as Student Tech (helping Yalies fix their computers, but mostly doing your homework). Each position requires a different set of qualifications, and some are more competitive than others to get (jobs in the admissions office are competitive), but in general, everyone who wants a job should be able to find one by the end of the year. And once you have said job, you’ll be safe for as long as you’d like to keep it.</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Towards the end of summer and at the beginning of fall semester, a lot of new jobs will be posted. You can subscribe to receive email notifications whenever a new job is posted so you don&#39;t miss any that might interest you.</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>You may notice a “level” next to each job listed. Levels simply correspond to the job’s hourly wage (As of Fall 2013 level 1 is $11.75, and it increases $.50 per level from there). They don&#39;t really have any indication of required skill sets or anything like that; for example some level 4 jobs are just clerical jobs that require minimal computer knowledge. You can go straight into a higher-level job without having had a lower-level job. These “Student Pay Rates” can be seen on the “Student Control Panel” page of </span><span class="c2"><a class="c1" href="http://yalestudentjobs.org">yalestudentjobs.org</a></span><span>.</span></p><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.ji6gyfa2nq2s"></a><span>Research</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>Many students at Yale are involved with research. If you have the determination and the interest, you shouldn&#39;t have trouble finding research work. Not only do you have the opportunity to do research with professors who teach in the undergraduate and graduate schools, but you can also work with professors in other schools such as the Medical School and the School of Forestry and Environmental Science. Think of it this way: if you&#39;re committed to working in a lab and you&#39;re willing to do it for free, you&#39;re providing extra manpower to a professor who doesn&#39;t need to pay you, and there&#39;s certainly a benefit to that. </span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>That being said, don&#39;t commit yourself to a lab too early on. Take some time to ease into your classes and extracurriculars to figure out what your workload is like. Working in a lab is often a large time commitment, and you don&#39;t want to leave a bad impression by promising to work in a lab and not being able to follow through.</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c12">Quick Tip: </span><span>Once you’re working in your lab (or, better yet, before you apply), ask the graduate students how they feel about their jobs! If they seem happy, you can aspire to become one of them,  and if not, you can benefit from the advance warning.</span></p><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.f2ktmeuz7z3o"></a><span>Community Service</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>There are far too many volunteer clubs and activities to list! They range from </span><span>teaching</span><span>/mentoring to social justice. Some of them (but definitely not even close to all) are listed here:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"><a class="c1" href="http://www.yale.edu/livingnh/community/volunteer.html">http://www.yale.edu/livingnh/community/volunteer.html</a></span><span> </span></p><p class="c0"><span> </span></p><p class="c0"><span>Many volunteer groups are also affiliated with </span><span class="c2"><a class="c1" href="http://dwighthall.org">Dwight Hall</a></span><span>, which is an umbrella organization for nonprofits at Yale.</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c12">Quick Tip: </span><span>If you’re interested in starting a new volunteer group, you should check to see if another, similar group exists which might have room for your ideas and projects. Occasionally, three or four different organizations have very similar outreach areas, which isn’t a problem, but can lead to a lack of helpful communication.</span></p><h2 class="c0"><a name="h.b5gjaivyve3a"></a><span>Sports</span></h2><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.vgnwj3e46ebn"></a><span>Varsity Sports</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>Yale’s vaunted history is incomplete without its Varsity Athletics program. Currently, Yale fields 35 teams in varsity intercollegiate athletic competition, with most teams competing in Division I – football competes in the Division I Football Championship Subdivision – and almost competing in the Ivy League. Certain exceptions, like the ECAC for hockey, are conferences that include other Ivy League schools as well.</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The history of Yale Bulldogs on athletic fields stretches back almost a century and a half – for example, Yale played its first football game in 1872 (and has been playing Harvard annually since 1875) and has 27 national championships, 2 Heisman Award winners, 100 All-Americans, and multiple NFL Hall of Famers to its name. But football is not the only program that can claim a long tradition of success – almost every sport at Yale has achieved success on a national level, including national championships in basketball, crew, swimming and diving, golf, squash, sailing, men’s lacrosse, among others, and, most recently, men’s hockey – we’re the 2012-2013 NCAA men’s hockey National Champions. In addition, Yale has produced more than 200 Olympians in a variety of disciplines who have earned 61 gold medals.</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Yale also boasts a number of historical and impressive athletic facilities:</span></p><ol class="c9 lst-kix_965bk07jthf0-0 start"><li class="c0 c4 c5"><span>Payne Whitney Gym is home to gymnastics, volleyball, fencing, and men’s and women’s basketball, squash, and swimming</span></li><li class="c0 c4 c5"><span>A short bus ride from Payne Whitney leads to another athletic complex, including Historic Yale Field (home of Yale Baseball), Coxe Cage (indoor track and field), the DeWitt Family Field (softball), and Reese Stadium, one of the best spots to watch a sunset on campus if you attend a lacrosse or soccer game at the right time of day  </span></li><li class="c0 c4 c5"><span>Yale men’s and women’s hockey compete at Ingalls Rink (AKA “The Whale”), located on Science Hill and designed by Eero Saarinen, perhaps better known for designing the Gateway Arch in St. Louis</span></li><li class="c0 c4 c5"><span>Crew and sailing compete a bit further away (the Yale Boathouse is in Derby, CT), but their home competitions are still accessible by bus</span></li><li class="c0 c4 c5"><span>There’s also Johnson Field (field hockey)</span></li><li class="c0 c4 c5"><span>And the Cullman-Heyman Tennis Center (guess)</span></li><li class="c0 c4 c5"><span>And finally, the crown jewel of Yale Athletics, the Yale Bowl (football, or, as international Yalies might refer to it, football, because this is America)</span></li></ol><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.pc1636jgp8s2"></a><span>Spectating</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>Watching Bulldog athletes in action is incredibly easy and, for home games, always free.

The biggest sporting event of the year is The Game–the annual football game against Harvard–which is held in New Haven and Cambridge in alternating years and routinely sells out both university&#39;s football venues, drawing not only students and locals, but also alumni from by the thousands. It is a quintessential Yale experience that is celebrated on a national level as an iconic and historical part of not only Yale and Harvard&#39;s history, but American history. (It even has </span><span class="c2"><a class="c1" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard%E2%80%93Yale_football_rivalry">its own page</a></span><span> on that other Wiki-based website people use sometimes.)</span></p><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.r3fw5e6jak5o"></a><span>Non-Varsity Sports (Club and Intramural)</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>The two main non-varsity athletic organizations are club and IM sports.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>(Tertiary organizations include the Freshman Olympics, informal beer pong tournaments, and Procrastination Pool, every weeknight at 3:00 am in the basement of your residential college.)</span></p><h4 class="c0"><a name="h.8jgfwy1uictv"></a><span>Club Sports</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>Club sports is the more competitive of the two. In some sports that do not have varsity teams, such as water polo or ultimate Frisbee, the club team is the highest level of competition at Yale. Commitment varies by sport; most have around 3 practices per week, but some practice once a week and some practice every day. Missing a practice is usually okay, but in some sports there is pressure from teammates to attend. Club teams are coached by varsity athletes, volunteers, or senior members of the team. Club teams travel, scrimmaging against other teams in the area or competing against other college teams to advance to national club championships. In popular sports such as soccer there may be tryouts, but lesser-known sports welcome new members and beginners. (For a low barrier to entry and high upside even for the non-competitive, we recommend the Yale Powerlifting Team.) There are some fees involved for equipment and tournament costs.</span></p><h4 class="c0"><a name="h.3oqvvbsim02e"></a><span>Intramural Sports</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>IM sports are organized competitions between teams representing residential colleges. They are less competitive than club sports, and usually there are no practices involved; you just show up for scheduled games. There may not be not as much of a team community experience because attendance can vary drastically from game to game, but there is usually a core group of IM athletes that attend regularly. IMs are a good way to meet upperclassmen and other students in your college -- especially those you wouldn’t have known otherwise. </span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>IM sports are considered less intense because the people who show up may not be particularly experienced or skilled in that sport, but the desire to represent your college honorably can inspire considerable competitive spirit. There are no fees, and usually equipment beyond basic athletic clothes will be provided. Some sports have no counterpart at the club or varsity level. There are no tryouts; beginners are always welcome. And sometimes, showing up is what matters most; forfeits for non-attendance happen occasionally, and every victory counts toward a college’s overall IM points. Once the Tyng Cup (like the Stanley Cup, but better) standings begin to sort themselves out, </span><span>IMs become an intense source of college pride and inter-college rivalry. </span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>In other words, there is great incentive to come</span><span> and support your college! Yale provides the equipment (although you might want to bring your own, since the quality isn’t necessarily the best).

Today, it aims to provide a sense of home and community for Black students. The House has a wide range of resident groups, ranging from the Black Men’s Union to Shades a Capella. For many students, The House is a place to do work, attend debates, hang out, or meet up with friends; there is something for everyone. Dean Rodney T. Cohen serves as the director of the Center. </span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The House is a warm and friendly community to which all students are welcome. It also offers the support of peer liaisons who help freshmen make the important transitions into a successful life at Yale. There will undoubtedly be numerous Yale-specific and community-wide events that will be held at the House to which all students are invited to participate. More information can be found on their website (</span><span class="c2"><a class="c1" href="http://afam.yalecollege.yale.edu/">http://afam.yalecollege.yale.edu/</a></span><span>). </span></p><h4 class="c0"><a name="h.yxcxmbw8fl1y"></a><span>Asian American Cultural Center</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>The Asian American Cultural Center (AACC) was established in 1981 as a space for Asian American students at Yale to hold events, discuss political and social issues, and most of all develop as a community. The AACC also provides a large number of resources, such as peer liaisons who support and connect freshmen as they transition to college life. Overall, there are more than 35 affiliated student organizations that use the house: political action committees, dance troupes, a cappella groups, cultural organizations, and many more all come under the AACC’s roof to explore different facets of Asian American identity. </span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The AACC is equipped with comfortable couches, a kitchen, a library, conference rooms, and a computer room. Students from all backgrounds are encouraged to stop by and say hello, especially during any of our numerous events throughout the year. The Center is located on 295 Crown Street and directed by Dean Saveena Dhall.

We are committed to developing a comfortable space where our diverse cultural heritage, history and traditions can be celebrated and explored by all Yale students and New Haven community members. In partnership with our many resident organizations, La Casa provides opportunities that foster a sense of belonging and pride while supporting the intellectual, personal, and social development of our students.</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Within the red brick walls of 301 Crown Street, students socialize, plan activities, cook together in a fully-equipped kitchen, discuss issues pertinent to Latin Americans/Latinos, and in general come together to create a warm and welcoming community. Students who visit the Center enjoy an ever-expanding library of books and resource materials on Latino and Latin American topics; a computer room in which to compose papers, check e-mail, and conduct online research; a large multi purpose gathering space; several organizational offices; and student lounges.

Theodore Van Alst, assistant dean of Yale College, is the director of the NACC. Van Alst, a promoter of the native community, brings a wealth of experience in Native American issues and serves as an advisor on matters academic, cultural and personal.</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The center plays an important role in supporting Yale’s Native community by providing a safe, fun environment for students of Native and non-Native descent to gather, learn about Native Americans and their stories, and to build friendships. This year the NACC is moving to a new location that has been completely renovated and suited to the cultural center’s needs. Now, the NACC will be a three-story building equipped with a kitchen, game room, computer room, classroom, and a sky-lit lounge. The NACC works to include various events including; speakers, dinners, study breaks, and movie nights.</span></p><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.rjnflz16hjlp"></a><span>Religious Life</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>Ranging from all sorts of religious support and general counseling (whether on finding a religious community or discovering your own unique religious or non-religious identity), to free ice cream, the Chaplain’s Office and its friendly staff will keep your souls and stomachs fed. The peer liaisons are there to talk about anything, and the bi-monthly study breaks, including pancakes, quesadillas etc., will keep you well rejuvenated.

Space, mentorship, and additional funding for student organizations is administered by the Office of LGBTQ Resources, which also houses Peer Liaisons, specially trained to serve as peer mentors to first years and act as conduits for the undergraduate groups.  Among the much celebrated special events attributed to Yale&#39;s LGBT community are Trans-Week, the biannual Sex Week, and the month long gay pride celebration in April (&quot;Gay-pril&quot;).</span></p><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.6s3novbequls"></a><span>Greek Life</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>The Greek scene at Yale is, for the most part, smaller and tamer than what one would find at a large state school. However, it still plays a significant role in the campus community and the lives of the many people who actively participate in Greek life. </span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>There are 9</span><span> fraternities </span><span>(Alpha Delta Phi, Alpha Epsilon Pi, Delta Kappa Epsilon, Chi Psi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Sigma Chi, Sigma Phi Epsilon, Sigma Nu, and Zeta Psi) </span><span>and 3 sororities</span><span> (Kappa Alpha Theta, Kappa Kappa Gamma, and Pi Beta Phi). Some of the frats tend to attract similar people (for example, lacrosse bros at ADPhi and Jewish students at AEPi), but all of them welcome anyone who wants to rush. The frats and sororities also differ to some degree regarding the level of commitment/participation expected. If you are interested in joining a Greek organization, it is recommend that you talk to people in each frat/sorority and attend rush events to get a feel for each organization before deciding which one fits well with you and what kind of experience you </span><span>want</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Rush itself is generally a laid-back and fun process, which really initiates interested Yalies into the Greek scene. For girls, rush period lasts all of 3 days (quite relaxed, next to the month-long a cappella rush process). Yale recently banned fall rush for fraternities and sororities, meaning that the earliest time a freshman can join a frat is in the second semester of freshman year. The rush period starts in the first few weeks of second semester, followed by a pledge period that can last the rest of the </span><span>semester</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Really, Greek life at Yale is as large or as small as you want it to be. Even if you are not interested in joining a frat/sorority, you can still attend most of their events and parties.</span></p><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.2s3rz449sa52"></a><span>Secret Societies</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>Despite their appeal in pop culture, the secret societies at Yale do not play a large role in student life, at least not until senior year.</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The &quot;Big Three&quot; secret societies (Skull and Bones, Scroll and Key, and Wolf&#39;s Head) are still around, but plenty of other secret societies have sprouted within the last few decades. The societies themselves have become somewhat less &quot;secretive&quot;; in recent years, Rumpus (our incredibly well-informed gossip rag) has published lists of the new taps for the Big Three. (The most recent edition also claims to list all of the seniors included in all of the current societies.) It&#39;s difficult to say more about the societies without being a senior and having firsthand knowledge of them, but there are a number of op-ed pieces available online (on the Yale Daily News and the Yale Herald, for example) if you&#39;re curious.</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Most societies have 12 to 15 seniors, and they meet on Thursday and Sunday nights. Generally, societies just offer an opportunity to meet a small group of other seniors; it&#39;s another facet of social life at Yale. (Just with more cloaks.)</span></p><h2 class="c0"><a name="h.5xmzw6kll2me"></a><span>Music</span></h2><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.yrez853cuvb1"></a><span>A Cappella</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>A cappella (singing without accompaniment, for the Glee-deprived) is HUGE at Yale. There are 15 a cappella groups in the Singing Group Council (SGC), the umbrella group that organizes most of the a cappella groups. There are also some singing groups that aren’t regulated by the council! Within the SGC, all but two of the groups are underclassmen a cappella groups, meaning they’re composed of freshmen through juniors. The two others, the Whiffenpoofs and Whim n’ Rhythm, are all-senior a cappella groups.</span></p><p class="c0"><span><br>Any underclassmen can audition for the groups, though most people choose to audition during their freshman year. The audition process - or “rush” process - also goes on for more than a month. Here’s what happens:</span></p><h4 class="c0"><a name="h.417ncdc32c0p"></a><span class="c12">Concerts</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>A cappella rush starts during Camp Yale with two huge concerts put on by all of the SGC a cappella groups. After the second concert, students (often freshmen, but not always!) rush to sign up for audition slots with all of the groups they like.</span></p><h4 class="c0"><a name="h.es6fnvj7qq56"></a><span class="c12">Rush Auditions</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>Throughout the next weekend, interested students prepare solos and go from audition to audition with the various groups; most auditions will include a warm-up, solo, and sight-reading/ear training exercises, although this varies from group to group. Don’t worry if you don’t read music or haven’t sung in high-school before! Many people involved in a cappella at Yale haven’t either, and the groups know this during auditions.</span></p><h4 class="c0"><a name="h.ynwaq7q56x63"></a><span class="c12">Rush Meals</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>Then, each auditionee gets rush meals with members of the groups. These meals are a chance to socialize with the group, get to know them, and tell them some more about yourself--they’re a testament to how close a cappella groups are here!</span></p><h4 class="c0"><a name="h.sbm5n1b1gbcl"></a><span class="c12">Call-Backs</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>In the next few weeks, you may get a call-back. If you do, congratulations! The callbacks are longer versions of your initial auditions, and can vary a lot between groups.</span></p><h4 class="c0"><a name="h.dmxuvrkb89at"></a><span class="c12">Tap Night</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>At a specified date by the SGC, every a cappella group will line up outside of Old Campus and hear songs by the all-senior a cappella groups. Once the singing stops, the groups rush from dorm to dorm to snag their favorite auditionees and officially induct them into the group. Once the night’s over, so is rush!</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c12">Quick Note: </span><span>Sometimes, students aren’t tapped by their favorite group, or any group they auditioned for. This will hurt for a few days, but like a bad grade, missing a tap is very survivable. Yale has tons of other outlets for singers, from religious choirs to musical theater -- you can definitely find a place for your passion outside the a cappella system!</span></p><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.kjqsznolq2a0"></a><span>Orchestras and Bands</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>There are many, many orchestras at Yale, including</span></p><ol class="c9 lst-kix_rwfjgd3t61yi-0 start"><li class="c0 c4 c5"><span>Yale Symphony Orchestra</span></li><li class="c0 c4 c5"><span>Berkeley College Orchestra</span></li><li class="c0 c4 c5"><span>Davenport Pops Orchestra (D-pops)</span></li><li class="c0 c4 c5"><span>Jonathan Edwards College Philharmonic</span></li><li class="c0 c4 c5"><span>and Saybrook College Orchestra</span></li></ol><p class="c0 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>While there are some music majors playing in these orchestras, the majority of students are majoring in something non-music related, and simply interested in playing their instrument. Yale’s orchestras cover a full range of ability levels, so everyone is able to find an orchestra suited for them. You can audition for as many orchestras as you’d like. If you play multiple instruments, you can audition for each of them.</span></p><h4 class="c0"><a name="h.9fz1qx7s4puu"></a><span>Yale Symphony Orchestra</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>One of the more prestigious orchestras is the Yale Symphony Orchestra (YSO), which mostly consists of students who have played in a youth orchestra or have some sort of musical awards. YSO has a few transfer students from Julliard and the New England Conservatory, to give you a sense of the more advanced end of the spectrum.</span></p><h4 class="c0"><a name="h.joc6nwoa222h"></a><span>Yale Bands</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>Yale University is also represented by the Yale University Bands: the Yale Precision Marching Band (YPMB), the Yale Concert Band (YCB), and the Yale Jazz Ensemble (YJE). Information about the bands, and audition materials for the 50-piece Concert Band (which plays orchestral transcriptions, band classics, and new commissions every year) as well as materials for the audition for the big band YJE, are available at </span><span class="c2"><a class="c1" href="http://www.yale.edu/yaleband/">http://www.yale.edu/yaleband/</a></span><span>.</span></p><p class="c0"><span><br>There, you can also learn about the antics of the wacky and lovable Yale Precision Marching Band: the guardians of Yale school spirit and performers of all things fun and cool.</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>“Auditions” for YPMB are rarely stressful, especially considering there is a section full of people who do not play instruments (the Squids, who play music on pots and who build incredible props for every halftime show) and that the marching band does not, in fact, march. Cracking jokes, playing the latest hits and classic rock, forming rude symbols with their collective bodies, and always ready to put on a show, the YPMB is a home for friends and anyone looking to have a good time making people smile, whether or not they want to spend a lot of their time on music at Yale.</span></p><h4 class="c0"><a name="h.3k5dfa78w29k"></a><span class="c12">Music lessons</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>Interested in taking music lessons at Yale? Want to learn a new instrument? You can read more about auditioning, taking lessons for credit or for a fee, etc. here: </span><span class="c2"><a class="c1" href="http://music.yale.edu/academics/lessons.htm">http://music.yale.edu/academics/lessons.html</a></span><span>. Be aware, though, that most students study with a (super-talented) graduate student in the School of Music, not with a faculty member. It is possible to study with a faculty member, but auditions are competitive, and an advanced degree of performance ability is necessary.</span></p><h4 class="c0"><a name="h.e4joxh4piph3"></a><span>Stores</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>There are two music stores on Audubon St.: Audubon Strings (a full-service store for string instruments, naturally) and Foundry Music (which is a more general music store carrying sheet music, music stands, reeds, metronomes, etc.)</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Farther away is Sam Ash in Amity, New Haven. They are the best place to go for guitar, bass, or amp repairs. They also have instruments for sale, including brass and woodwinds. You can take the B2 bus to get there.</span></p><h2 class="c0"><a name="h.ump9mz3wmbp"></a><span>Comedy</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>As you might imagine, plenty of extracurriculars at Yale can be competitive, and improv tends to be one of them. Obviously, being funny is key, but groups like improv are also looking to find people who they think would get along well with the rest of the group. You aren’t guaranteed a spot in any group, even if you audition for all 6/7/8 improv and sketch groups (the number changes yearly).</span></p><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.wu2n17ewu342"></a><span>Improv Comedy</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>The improv-comedy scene at Yale began in the 80s, and has been growing ever since. Improv is an intense collaboration between sharp-minded actors. Contrary to popular belief, the best improv artists are not the people who can produce jokes on command, but the people who can bring creative ideas to a scene without disrespecting their partners&#39; ideas. </span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>An improv group at Yale usually has two rehearsals every week, and performs once every couple of weeks in a small theater. These shows are very popular, and it is common for the theater to reach capacity ten minutes before the performance even starts. Similarly, improv auditions are very well attended. Anybody who is interested in auditioning should know the subtle differences between each of the four established groups...</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Just Add Water: Short-form, long-form, and musical improv. JAW improvises songs as well as scenes, and does a twenty-minute improvised musical at the end of every show.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>The Exit Players: Short-form and long-form improv. Exit is best known for its parody of Jeopardy, which requires the rapid production of one-liners.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>The Purple Crayon: Mostly long-form improv. A Crayon show will often feature one or two extended sets of improv, each based on a &quot;Harold&quot; structure. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>The Viola Question: Mostly short-form improv. VQ is best known for The Oracle, a game in which questions from members of the audience are given cryptic answers.</span></p><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.2d7hh4yq8dks"></a><span>Sketch Comedy</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>Are you funny? But does it take you a couple of minutes to figure out your jokes? Well, then you might just be perfect for sketch comedy at Yale.  You may be asking yourself, “What is sketch comedy? Is that the one where you make up everything on the spot?” Why no, you silly freshman, sketch comedy is when you make up everything before the show even starts. It’s almost exactly like Saturday Night Live minus the occasional Justin Timberlake appearance.  Sketch comedy groups write and perform all of their own material.  But no worries, even if you have no experience acting or are illiterate, you too can join a sketch comedy group.  The audition process is very laid back.  </span></p><p class="c0 c8 c20"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Within the first few weeks of school, Yale’s sketch comedy groups will be performing small showcases so you can laugh at them and get a feel for their individual styles of comedy.  As with a capella, there will be auditions (no preparation required), callbacks, and a “tap” process for a few new members. Just show up, be yourself, take risks, and make us laugh.  There are four sketch comedy groups at Yale: The 5</span><span class="c26">th</span><span> Humour, Red Hot Poker, Outside Joke, and Sphincter.  Each group has its own personality, so audition for all of them so you can really get a feel for which group of weirdos you want to spend the next four years with. </span></p><p class="c0 c8 c20"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c12">Quick Tip: </span><span>There is one audition-free outlet for funny people at Yale: The </span><span class="c21">Yale Record, </span><span>our old and once-respectable humor magazine. Meetings are always open to all!</span></p><h2 class="c0"><a name="h.t7onxjw9eqhz"></a><span>Student Publications</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>If you like writing, editing, graphic design, or talking to interesting people, you should consider writing for a Yale publication! There’s a huge number of them (probably around 30 at any given time that accept student writers), and the landscape shifts a little bit each year. Just in the last two years, five or six new publications have hit the dining hall tables (the best place to find them), and several others have mysteriously disappeared. But whether you’re writing for the Yale Daily News (YDN) or starting a magazine yourself, writing at Yale is a fun and fulfilling pastime!</span></p><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.45isxzmlrsk0"></a><span>Why write?</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>Lots of reasons! For one, you get writing guidance from experienced and talented fellow students, whether you’re a journalist at the Herald or an essayist with Light and Truth. For two, journalism is probably the best possible way to speak with a wide variety of interesting people, inside and outside of Yale, over the course of the school year. The following message format (adjust as needed) is likely to get you a fifteen-minute phone conversation, or at least an email exchange, with almost any professor, writer, non-White House politician, or other semi-famous non-celebrity person:</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c16"><span>Dear (their name),</span></p><p class="c0 c16"><span>        </span></p><p class="c0 c16"><span>Hello! My name is (your name), and I’m writing an article on (relevant topic to them) for </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span>the Yale (name of publication). I really admire your work on (relevant thing they’ve done), and would love to pick your brain about (topic of your article). Do you have ten minutes* for a phone interview sometime before (due date of article)? If not, could I ask a few questions over email? Thank you for any time you can spare, and for (good thing the person is doing in real life).</span></p><p class="c0 c8 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c16"><span>Best,</span></p><p class="c0 c16"><span>(your first name)</span></p><p class="c0 c16 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span>*Once they give you ten minutes, as long as you’re a good interviewer, you can probably keep them on the phone for more time.</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The Yale Politic does a very good job of this. Check out their website for interviews with a huge collection of politicians, ambassadors, and the like. </span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Finally, writing at Yale lets you sculpture your time pretty freely. Debate and sports and a cappella have fixed schedules and will sometimes take you away from work for a full day or more. Unless you’re an editor for the YDN, you can choose what times you work on articles in a given issue cycle, and if you feel overwhelmed, there’s usually no obligation to write any more articles than you can handle. Whether you’re looking to work for the New York Times or just want to see your name in print, Yale’s publication scene offers an outlet for virtually any writerly idea.</span></p><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.z07dg09kj0nn"></a><span>Publications at Yale</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>This list does not include every publication, because there are a TON of them. We have, however, tried to list the name of every publication we could find. Generally, a quick Google search will get you the names of people you can contact about writing. If you’d like to write for a publication, emailing an editor is usually your best bet; almost all of them are constantly looking for new material. And if you’re a designer or artist interested in contributing visual content, even better! Artists are always in demand around Yale’s writing scene.</span></p><h4 class="c0"><a name="h.2j5v9icxeski"></a><span>Yale Daily News</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>You’ll see a lot of these lying around, because it’s a daily paper and comes out every day and stuff. They do an excellent job reporting on the minutiae of Yale life, and their op-ed section (not editorial--editorials are written by editors!) gives students and professors the chance to make their opinions known to the student body at large. The YDN gets more readers on a regular basis than any other paper, and accepts a huge number of new staff writers each year. However, “heelers” (soon-to-be staff writers) have to write ten articles in a pretty short period to join, and contributing regular content means editing your articles late at night in the YDN building. Some people love the thrill of daily journalism, while others prefer a more relaxed approach, but any discussion of Yale writing options has to start with the YDN.</span></p><h4 class="c0"><a name="h.2j5v9icxeski"></a><span>Yale Herald</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>Yale second-most-read publication, the </span><span class="c21">Herald </span><span>comes out weekly and focuses on longer</span><span class="c12"> </span><span>pieces than the YDN, alongside personal essays and cultural criticism. If you’re a film or music buff, the Reviews section offers a great opportunity to make your thoughts public. And if you can’t help but inject your personality into your journalistic work, the Herald is friendlier to opinion and personal style than many other publications. </span></p><h4 class="c0"><a name="h.2j5v9icxeski"></a><span>New Journal</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>The New Journal takes on Yale from a left-leaning perspective, with a special emphasis on the city of New Haven and social justice issues. Their long-form journalism is some of the best writing on campus, and they offer anything from 400-word blurbs to 4000-word narrative epics. If you’re interested in questions of class and privilege, or looking to get more involved with the city, TNJ might just be the place for you.</span></p><h4 class="c0"><a name="h.2j5v9icxeski"></a><span>Yale Record</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>Yale’s humor magazine, and the oldest college humor magazine in the country (soon to celebrate its 142nd birthday!). The Record publishes comedy and cartoons and holds weekly meetings open to any writer. Much of the magazine’s content is short “mailbags” (fake letters) and “snews” (Onion-style news headlines), so new writers can get involved with as little as a five-word joke. The Record also hosts stand-up comedy nights and brings in funny people to give Master’s Teas on a regular basis. If you like to laugh, the Record could be the most fun you’ll have in the next four years. (Not joking.)</span></p><h4 class="c0"><a name="h.2j5v9icxeski"></a><span>Yale Globalist</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>For world travelers and would-be travelers. The Globalist goes far outside the Yale Bubble to survey the rest of the planet, from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe. If plane tickets aren’t in your future, have no fear! Skype’s video-chat feature and international call capability allow you to communicate easily with international sources, and sourcing experts within the United States is also fine and dandy. Those interested can pitch articles to the paper magazine, offer to write for the blog, join the design team, and/or sign up for the Globalist Trip (a several-week summer adventure that combines an international vacation with a journalistic expedition). Bon voyage!</span></p><h4 class="c0"><a name="h.2j5v9icxeski"></a><span>Rumpus</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>Yale’s premier gossip magazine, and only gossip magazine. Rumpus knows more than anyone else what happens on campus (as you can tell by their Tumblr, RumpChat, which accepts anonymous tips on the Yale social scene). Rumpus doesn’t publish often (twice a year, more or less), but they can lay claim to the single most popular publication at Yale--a list of Yale’s 50 Most Beautiful People referred to as “50 Most”. Rumpus parties harder, and works less harder, than any other publication out there. Whether you’re a Greek-life guru or just a party animal, call them up for a good time.</span></p><h4 class="c0"><a name="h.2j5v9icxeski"></a><span>Yale Politic</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>Covers politics at the city, state, national, and international level, in a style that strives to match monthly magazines like The Atlantic or The Economist. Maintains a massive, oft-updated blog and invites prestigious guests (Malcolm Gladwell, for example) to Yale on a regular basis. A great way to kick off your Washington career or contact the Senate committee leader in charge of your favorite partisan issue.</span></p><h4 class="c0"><a name="h.2j5v9icxeski"></a><span>Other publications</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>Here goes. Sorry to anyone I miss!</span></p><ol class="c9 lst-kix_ydc3txke4pon-0 start"><li class="c0 c4 c5"><span>The Yale Literary Magazine (short stories and poetry; publishes twice per year, and tends to be quite competitive)</span></li><li class="c0 c4 c5"><span>Out of Order (fashion, art, movies, music, mostly publishes online but is read by a great many non-Yalies)</span></li><li class="c0 c4 c5"><span>Yale Scientific (general science articles, published monthly)</span></li><li class="c0 c4 c5"><span>Flourish (studies human well-being from a humanist perspective; covers psychology, art, philosophy, and more)</span></li><li class="c0 c4 c5"><span>Broad Recognition (feminist blog, also publishes a semi-regular zine)</span></li><li class="c0 c4 c5"><span>Vita Bella (for all things related to happiness and beauty)</span></li><li class="c0 c4 c5"><span>The Epicurean (food and cuisine, from recipes to restaurant reviews)</span></li><li class="c0 c4 c5"><span>Accent (all articles must be written in a foreign language; topics vary widely)</span></li><li class="c0 c4 c5"><span>The Critic (well-written, thoughtful reviews of recent books, doesn’t seem to be online)</span></li><li class="c0 c4 c5"><span>Q (LGBTQ culture and issues)</span></li><li class="c0 c4 c5"><span>China Hands (all things China)</span></li><li class="c0 c4 c5"><span>Light and Truth (published by Yale Political Union’s Conservative party, is conservative)</span></li><li class="c0 c4 c5"><span>Logos and Shibboleth (Christian and Jewish philosophy, respectively)</span></li><li class="c0 c4 c5"><span>The Yale Economic Review/Historical Review/Journal of Public Health/Journal of Medicine and Law (all pretty much what they sound like, and fairly academic)</span></li><li class="c0 c4 c5"><span>Any other publication you want!

(Note: when we say </span><span class="c21">some</span><span>, that is what we mean. There are parties at Yale we’ve heard of, but don’t have time to describe here. There are also parties at Yale that haven’t yet been imagined -- maybe the ones you’ll be throwing this year. If you do, be sure to invite us!)</span></p><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.dwdcckjkttl9"></a><span>Arts and Performances</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>If the party scene isn’t your thing, you’re still in luck; Yale has a lot of fun social alternatives that don’t involve partying. For example, the Radio House, which is the center of operations for Yale Radio, will host concerts every Friday night with up-and-coming bands. Comedy troupes on campus put on performances once or twice a semester that, without fail, will have any audience on the verge of delirium with laughter. </span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Another great option is going to attend an a cappella show with one of Yale’s many incredibly talented singing groups. Each group brings a different style and character to a show, making them all really fun to check out, and your a capella friends will love you forever for coming out to see them! The Yale Arts Calendar, which can be found online, is also always full of really cool drama performances or exhibitions that never fail to impress. For more on all of this, see the extracurricular section.</span></p><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.htgpva2btbui"></a><span>Mixers</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>Another great way to socialize with other Yalies is through inter-activity mixers. Parties in the Yale Political Union, club sports teams, student government groups, and all other types of groups will organize mixers with each other, allowing Yalies to get to know people in different circles, all while having a great time.</span></p><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.hqqd3tbr0gpc"></a><span>Residential College Activities</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>Groups within residential colleges will often sponsor fun activities for the members of that college—between Freshman Counselor (FroCo) events and Student Activities Council (SAC) functions, you may see study-breaks or smoothie nights that help break up a tough school </span><span>week</span><span>. Colleges will also sponsor awesome outings, usually organized by the Master’s Office, or specific councils within the college. These trips can range from visits to New York City to see a baseball game, a Broadway show, or some beautiful paintings at the Met to nature excursions in the mountains of the northeast to skiing or to local apple orchards for a beautiful day in nature.</span></p><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.97vhoefr5ikt"></a><span>Global Grounds</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>One other great alternative social space is Yale’s Global Grounds. Run through the Chaplain’s Office, Global Grounds is a weekly weekend coffee house open Fridays and Saturdays from 10pm-2am in the Dwight Hall Common Room on Old Campus. Global Grounds offers free coffee, tea, food, board games, live music, trivia nights, and art shows. It&#39;s a fun place to relax, meet up with friends, and just hang out.</span></p><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.9cw37bqerojn"></a><span>Movies/TV</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>But why leave your suite to have a good time with friends? As long as you have a TV in your common room, renting a movie can be a great option for enjoying a nice, low-key night with people you like. There’s no shortage of DVD’s in Bass library, all of which are provided by the Yale College Council, and which are available for rental. Another really cool option is to use Tivli, a service which, if you are on campus, provides additional channels to students (including HBO, for that one show about thrones everyone’s been telling us about. True Blood?) If you want to see a movie in theaters, head with some friends to Criterion Cinemas on Temple Street. The theater features a great college-town mix of popcorn flicks and independent cinema.</span></p><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.4rr9s1mf8fpo"></a><span>Cooking &amp; Baking</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>Residential colleges each have a small kitchen that students can use to bake things. Some stock the kitchen with some staples (such as baking soda and oil), but most expect you to supply your own ingredients. Invite some friends to join you in cooking, and invite even more people to come and eat what you make! As far as we’ve smelled, popular dishes include cookies, pie, brownies, holiday meals, and ethnic dishes from every continent but Antarctica. (Unless you’re in JE, which keeps a ten-pound bag of shredded penguin in the freezer, for souffles and such.)</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>If you just like baking/cooking, many butteries would love to have you join in as a guest chef - you make something, and they’ll advertise it to the college for you. The buttery may even be able to supply ingredients to fuel your cooking desires if you plan ahead of time (although you probably can’t make money off of it personally).</span></p><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.f82xsbpxefxb"></a><span>Board Game Parties</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>Many students bring board games to campus with them. Some organizations and cultural houses have their own sets of board games, and they’re usually willing to let anyone in the group use them whenever.</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12">A few popular choices:</span><span> Apples to Apples, Bananagrams, Cards Against Humanity, Checkers, Chess, Cranium, Settlers of Catan, Sorry, Scattergories, Taboo, Words With... Scrabble</span></p><h2 class="c0"><a name="h.kfu0yrpdj3"></a><span>Parties</span></h2><h3 class="c0 c14"><a name="h.1ighzze3lypd"></a><span>Alcohol</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>In the US, you must be 21 or older to legally drink alcohol. Alcohol is present on campus, but there may be repercussions to drinking if you are underage. Though most people are able to enjoy alcohol responsibly most of the time, some people will overshoot their limits. Yale’s official alcohol policy can be found at</span><span class="c2"><a class="c1" href="http://yalecollege.yale.edu/content/yale-college-regulations-alcoholic-beverages"> http://yalecollege.yale.edu/content/yale-college-regulations-alcoholic-beverages</a></span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Yale believes that student health is much more important than student discipline. If there is reason to suspect that a fellow student needs medical attention for intoxication, you shouldn’t hesitate to take them to the Yale Health Center. (Clear signs of potential danger include vomiting, memory loss, and loss of consciousness.) He or she will be kept while the effects of the alcohol wear off (usually overnight). More severe cases of alcohol poisoning will result in a trip to Yale New Haven Hospital. </span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Here is a quick guide to reaching Yale Health:</span></p><ol class="c9 lst-kix_7ekqkfaydk7a-0 start"><li class="c0 c4 c5"><span>Take the mini-bus 203-432-6330 to Yale Health - if the person can walk unassisted.</span></li><li class="c0 c4 c5"><span>Call 911 or Yale Police 203-432-4400 - if the person is injured or non-responsive.</span></li><li class="c0 c4 c5"><span class="c2"><a class="c1" href="http://yalehealth.yale.edu/acutecare">Acute Care</a></span><span> 203-432-0123 - if you don&#39;t know what to do.</span></li></ol><p class="c0 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>There is no direct punishment from Yale for arriving at Yale Health for drinking-related reasons: the school’s highest priority is the student’s safety. However, if you do end up at Yale Health, your residential college dean</span><span> will be informed</span><span>. He or she will likely schedule meeting with you, and it might be recommended that you get in touch with one of Yale’s alcohol </span><span>counselors</span><span>. The focus is completely on preventing a recurring problem.</span></p><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.1ighzze3lypd"></a><span>Party Locations - On-Campus Housing</span></h3><h4 class="c0"><a name="h.68rry680fhs"></a><span>Party Suites</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>At Yale, not all suites are configured alike. Some students, as they progress in their careers here, decide to live in larger suites with lots of close friends. Naturally, these rooms become gathering places, and in some cases, they become raging spaces. Some notable examples are the Saybrook Twelve-Pack, the Branford God Quad, and the TD Octet. Starting last year, Yale required students to register dorm parties expected to host more than </span><span>20 guests</span><span>. The process is easy, just fill out a form at your master’s office at least 48 hours in advance, and you’re set.</span></p><h4 class="c0"><a name="h.68rry680fhs"></a><span>College Parties</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>Many times over the year, you won’t even have to leave the comfort of the residential colleges, or more broadly, Yale facilities, to have a really good time partying with friends. In some colleges, the Student Activities Councils will organize parties, sometimes closed to students from different colleges, but many times open to the whole undergrad community. These nights can be some of the most fun nights of the year--sometimes too fun (rest in peace, Safety Dance). Spirits run high over events like Calhoun’s Trolley Night or Pierson’s Inferno, making them the perfect times to rage with friends--and not always the ones you see in your usual social setting. Some colleges also organize semi-formals (date optional), so come prepared with your finest attire.</span></p><h4 class="c0"><a name="h.68rry680fhs"></a><span>College Screws</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>A word to the wise: prepared to get screwed! Also, prepare for jokes about the word “screw”. The phrase is a cultural phenomenon at Yale. Confused? Don’t be. Throughout the year, residential colleges will host their Screw nights--date dances where you (theoretically) have no idea who your date will be! Here’s the deal: you tell your roommate or suitemate what you’re looking for in a date (flowing blond hair, poetic talents, basic competence with Einstein’s theory of special relativity.), and your roommate will begin asking around to find your perfect match. On the night of Screw, you’ll meet your date in some clever way arranged by your matchmaker, enjoy the night, and ride off into the New Haven sunset...well, usually not. New Haven is cloudy. But the dance itself usually a blast. </span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c29"><span class="c12">Quick Tip:</span><span> Be nice to your roommate before screw (for obvious reasons). And if they’re willing to set you up, set them up in return. In case you’re tempted to prank them with someone surprising, you’ll want to brush up on your </span><span class="c2"><a class="c1" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner&#39;s_dilemma">Prisoner’s Dilemma</a></span><span> theory.</span></p><h4 class="c0"><a name="h.68rry680fhs"></a><span>Freshman Screw</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>Residential college screws are only preparation for the real thing: Freshman Screw. Organized by the Freshman Class Council, Freshman Screw is exactly what you’re guessing it is: one big dance with the whole freshman class (dates can be non-freshmen). Not to be didactic, but one more piece of advice on screw: act fast for Freshman Screw. The whole class is going to be looking for a date, and you might just find that the most worthy candidates are gone--and no one wants to disappoint their roommate.</span></p><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.1ighzze3lypd"></a><span>Party Locations - Off-Campus Housing</span></h3><h4 class="c0"><a name="h.68rry680fhs"></a><span>Fraternities</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>There are nine fraternities on campus: Alpha Delta Phi, Alpha Epsilon Pi, Delta Kappa Epsilon, Chi Psi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Sigma Chi, Sigma Phi Epsilon, Sigma Nu, and Zeta Psi. Some of the frats are associated with sports teams (ADPhi – lacrosse; DKE – football; SigNu – soccer and tennis; Zeta – football and basketball), but these associations do not exclude non-members of those teams from joining. Each frat generally throws weekend parties once every few weeks, but a frat like SAE will throw a late-night party every Thursday night for Yalies looking to blow-off steam after a long academic week. See the extracurricular section for more information about fraternities. </span></p><h4 class="c0"><a name="h.68rry680fhs"></a><span>Sororities</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>Yale also has three sororities: Kappa Alpha Theta, Kappa Kappa Gamma, and Pi Beta Phi. Though these sororities may have houses, the houses don’t really function as party spaces, but more as residential spaces for close friends in the sororities.</span></p><h4 class="c0"><a name="h.68rry680fhs"></a><span>Fence Club</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>One unique organization on campus is Fence Club, a “coed fraternity” that hosts parties and creates close bonds between guys and girls in the organization. Fence Club traditionally appeals to people who don’t buy into the traditional notion of fraternities and sororities, and who value having a common identity with members of the opposite sex.</span></p><h4 class="c0"><a name="h.68rry680fhs"></a><span>Sports Houses</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>Some Yale varsity sports teams own houses where they throw parties. So if you want to get down with the Yale men’s hockey team (NCAA champs!), the heavyweight crew team, the lightweight crew team, the sailing team, or the swim team, feel free to hit up any one of their houses, as long as the lights are on and stuff. Don’t break any windows.</span></p><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.1ighzze3lypd"></a><span>Party Locations - Businesses</span></h3><h4 class="c0"><a name="h.68rry680fhs"></a><span>Toads</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>A concert venue and bar that gets converted every Wednesday and Saturday for a college-student-only dance party. On Wednesday, Toads is exclusively open to Yale students (i.e. you need a Yale ID to get in), but on Saturday, there are generally crowds from Quinnipiac University that come as well. Toads is especially popular amongst freshmen and sophomores, as people below 21 can get in by paying a $5 cover charge. There’s no nice way of saying this -- Toad’s is quite grimy. But even Yalies can (and do) set aside their pride and embrace their primal side every Wednesday and Saturday night.</span></p><h4 class="c0"><a name="h.68rry680fhs"></a><span>Box 63</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>A more traditional bar that can be popular as a late-night hangout option for (generally) upperclassmen. You might find Yalies at Box on any (extended) weekend night—Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and yes, even Sunday. </span></p><h4 class="c0"><a name="h.68rry680fhs"></a><span>Elevate/Oaxaca/Thali Too</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>These are a few of the night-club/bar venues that Yale organizations rent out for parties.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c8"><span></span></p><h1 class="c0 c17"><a name="h.c541fm841nzt"></a><span>Transportation</span></h1><p class="c0"><span>Yalies dedicate a large amount of time to figuring out how to get from point A to point B in the cheapest possible manner. Whether it’s getting from school to the airport, going to visit your friends at other colleges, getting home safely after a night out, or trekking from Old Campus to Science Hill (a big one for pre-meds), the following is a rundown on all the essentials you need to know about transportation.</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Huge thanks go to </span><span class="c2"><a class="c1" href="http://rhig.physics.yale.edu/~nattrass/HowToGetToAirports.html">http://rhig.physics.yale.edu/~nattrass/HowToGetToAirports.html</a></span><span> for some of the airport transportation content!</span></p><h2 class="c0"><a name="h.k34d8hqpsl04"></a><span>To Airports</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>The airports you will be using most frequently to fly home will be:</span></p><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.325m6rf6ngs7"></a><span>Tweed New Haven Airport (HVN)</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>Tweed is served only by US Airways, and if US Airways does not have a direct flight from New Haven to your airport, you will need to connect in Philly. Tweed can be reached by taxi cab or by CT Transit bus. The car ride from Tweed to campus is around 15 minutes, and a cab costs around $20 including tip. </span></p><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.325m6rf6ngs7"></a><span>Bradley International Airport (BDL)</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>Bradley International Airport in Hartford, CT services more airlines than Tweed and is a common airport for Yale students. Bradley is accessible by car, taxi, or shuttle.</span></p><h4 class="c0"><a name="h.2qegzu7reiq7"></a><span>Taxi</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>A taxi to Bradley costs $110 without tip. The trip should take a little under an hour. </span></p><h4 class="c0"><a name="h.2qegzu7reiq7"></a><span>Go Shuttle</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>Go Shuttle does not operate a shared van service to Bradley, but you can reserve a private car for up to 3 passengers. The total for a one way trip is $139.55 including gratuity. You must make a reservation ahead of time.</span></p><h4 class="c0"><a name="h.2qegzu7reiq7"></a><span>CT Limo</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>CT Limo runs a shared van service from Phelps Gate to the airport for $42 one-way and $65 roundtrip. The total time is around one hour and 20 minutes for a one-way trip. The only destination CT Limo is most effective going to is Bradley; all other locations have better options. You must make a reservation ahead of time. </span></p><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.325m6rf6ngs7"></a><span>New York: LaGuardia (LGA)</span></h3><h4 class="c0"><a name="h.2qegzu7reiq7"></a><span>Train and Bus</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>If you can plan in advance, are adventurous, and have limited luggage, you can take the train and bus to LaGuardia. This costs around $17 which makes it significantly less expensive than shuttles. The trip should take around 3 hours. </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span>1.

To use the bike share bikes which are white, Zagster bikes at select stations, you need to pay a $20 annual membership fee that will be reimbursed if you take a Bike Safety class and register with Zagster. If you own your own bike, you should get a solid metal bike lock. If you can avoid it, don’t leave your bike unattended for long periods of time, especially off-campus.</span></p><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.hmxwiviyu0d8"></a><span>Other Wheeled Locomotion</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>We doesn’t know anything about motorbikes or motor scooters, but they’re probably not fast enough to make up for how much parking sucks in classroom areas. Regular scooters, on the other hand, are getting more popular--faster than walking, cheaper than biking, no locks or helmets necessary! Skateboards are a thing if you can manage one. Roller skates, not so much. Land skis have been sighted, but if you’re going to get around campus on land skis, you probably knew this to be the case before picking up this handbook.</span></p><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.325m6rf6ngs7"></a><span>Walk</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>The brisk walk, too, will become your friend (whether you like it or not).
